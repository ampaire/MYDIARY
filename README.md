# MYDIARY

My diary is an online application where users can pen down their thoughts, secrets and feelings. It is my first project done with Html and css and basically it introduced me to the basics of html and css.

## Features
At the moment it holds dummy data. It was just to help me understand how to create HTML5 files, linking more than one HTML file, adding styles from Css to the HTML. I added buttons to safely navigate through the pages and links to the pages.

## Prerequisites
- HTML5
- CSS
- Git

## COntributions
Since this is my first project in HTML and Css  (and of course programming), I know there are many areas that are lacking. To contribute to this project, create an issue under the [issues](https://github.com/ampaire/MYDIARY/issues) or fork this project  and create a pull request to the development branch
